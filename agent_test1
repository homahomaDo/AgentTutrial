Wrap individual code snippets in an expression to make them into movable blocks
eg if(0 == 0) turns into all comparison expression blocks (somehow?)
eg if(variable) enables the "make a variable" section

@showdialogue makes that slide on the tutorial pop out and add a "Next" button
```template give the students some starter blocks
```blocks shows the students a hint
```ghost provides access to blocks without putting them in the workspace or hint
``|| agent.text ||`` will make the text the same colour as the block menu (you need to change the first word to the name of the menu)
-->

<!-- block combinations that will show up by default in their workspace -->
```template
agent.teleportToPlayer()
agent.teleportToPlayer()
agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
agent.place(FORWARD)
agent.destroy(FORWARD)
agent.collectAll()
player.onTravelled(WALK, function () {
})
```

<!-- blocks you want available to players, based on js code -->
```blocks
player.say(":)")
player.onChat("run", function () {})
agent.teleportToPlayer()
agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
agent.place(FORWARD)
agent.destroy(FORWARD)
agent.collectAll()
if(agent.inspect(AgentInspection.Block, FORWARD) == 0)
if(agent.getPosition() == 0)
if(agent.detect(AgentDetection.Block, FORWARD) == 0)
agent.drop(FORWARD, 1, 1)
